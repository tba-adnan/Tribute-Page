    <h1>Hommage : Fatima Al-Fihri </h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Fatima was born around 800 AD in the town of Kairouan, in present-day Tunisia. She is of Arab Qurayshi descent, hence the nisba "al-Qurashiyya", 'the Qurayshi one'. Her family was part of a large migration to Fez from Kairouan. Although her family did not start out wealthy, her father, Mohammed al-Fihri, became a successful merchant. When he died, this wealth was inherited by Fatima, and her sister Maryam. It is with this money that they went on to leave their legacy with. Little is known about her personal life, except for what was recorded by 14th century historian Ibn Abi-Zarâ€™. This may be partly due to the fact that the Al-Qarawiyyin's archives suffered a large fire in 1323. Al-Fihri was married, but both her husband and father died shortly after the wedding. Her father left his wealth to both Fatima and her sister, his only children. She and her sister Maryam were well-educated and studied the Islamic jurisprudence Fiqh and the Hadith, or the records of Prophet Muhammed. Both went on to found mosques in Fes: Fatima founded Al-Qarawiyyin and Maryam founded Al-Andalus. This idea was spurred on by the fact that due to all the Muslims fleeing like Fatima and her family, they were all gathering immigrants that were devout worshippers keen on learning and studying their faith. With as many immigrants as there were, there was overcrowding and not enough space, resources, or teachers to accommodate them.According to Ibn Abi Zar', Fatima used the money inherited from her father to build the Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque, named for the immigrants from her city. Her sister Maryam built the Andalusian Mosque, named for the immigrants from the city of Andalusia, present-day southern Spain. Although they started out as mosques, or religious gathering places for Muslims, Fatima's community had outgrown their mosque and she vowed to build a new and larger one. Fatima used the money she inherited from her father to purchase a mosque that was built around 845 AD under the supervision of King Yahya ibn Muhammad. She then rebuilt it and bought the surrounding land, doubling its size.</p>
